At the Supreme Court, since the dismissal of Chief Justice Gopal Prasad Parajuli on March 14, Deepak Raj Joshee has been working as the acting chief. The Judicial Council has recommended Joshee and justices Om Prakash Mishra and Cholendra Shumsher Rana to the Constitutional Council (CC) as the CJ candidates. The CC has selected neither the CIAA chief nor the CJ.“The Speaker is willing to forge consensus among the parties on the regulations before presenting the document to the House for approval. He believes that the regulations should be based on consensus,” Gopal Nath Yogi, secretary at the House of Representatives, told the Post. The ruling and opposition parties are divided over suspension of a lawmaker facing judicial custody and on the number of parliamentary committees. The regulation guides the House business.According to Yogi, endorsement of the budget for the next fiscal year is not possible before June 24. The regulations will be on the House agenda only after the budget is passed. The House committees, also called mini-parliaments, watch the activities of the ministries concerned.Parliamentarians to be orientatedKATHMANDU: The Parlia-ment Secretariat is preparing to orient members of the federal parliament on the proceedings of both the Houses within a week. Sessions of the Upper House have been put off until June 10 while the Lower House will also be adjourned for a week after Sunday. As new lawmakers are unaware of how parliamentary proceedings go and of their rights and limitations, the two-day orientation focuses on the issues, Yogi told the Post.

After the government failed to fill the vacancies at the local level, applications from interested staffers were invited.Around 8,000 applicants, most of them by those already serving at the local units, seek transfers to their preferred destinations at the local level, according to the ministry.In March, the Cabinet approved a total of 37,257 positions for municipalities, rural municipalities and District Coordination Committees. With a total of 21,716 officials already in service, the local level requires around 16,000 staffers more.The ministry believes that around 8,000 staffers could be arranged for the local bodies from the dissolved district offices and those that have seen staff cuts.“There will still be a shortage of some 8,000 staffers at the local level,” said Suresh Adhikari, spokesperson for the Federal Affairs Ministry.In case the central government fails to depute officials in the required numbers, local governments will be able to recruit staffers on contract basis.But the local governments will have to manage necessary resources for the purpose. The federal government has not given them funds for hiring additional staff.“Since all the local units don’t have enough resources to recruit officials, there has to be some sort of arrangement from the central government,” said Adhikari.Ministry officials said the number of offices of the central government could not be reduced as expected due to strong pressure from the political leadership and staffers working there not to dissolve them.“For instance, we had expected various departments under several ministries to come down to 30 but the organisation and management (O&M) survey maintained the number of such departments at 53,” said an official.On the recommendation of the O&M survey, nine departments have been scrapped, according to the ministry. The government aims to deploy the surplus workforce by June to the provinces and the local level. From the new fiscal year, salary would not be released for more officials than determined by the O&M survey for the central government offices.This means the government must mobilise surplus staffers to the provinces and local government offices.Secretary Dinesh Thapaliya said the government would try to send as many staffers as possible to the local level. “There will be a balanced distribution of government staffers,” he said. This will be a temporary arrangement of officials.Permanent adjustment will be made once the government completes the O&M survey of offices at the central, provincial and local levels.', 'image_link': 'img not available'}, {'image_link': 'https://assets-cdn.ekantipur.com/images/the-kathmandu-post-printedition/rjpn_1527988731-600x0.jpg', 'title': 'RJP-N to join central govt after leaders’ release', 'date': 'Kathmandu', 'source': 'ekantipur', 'news_link': 'https://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-06-03/rjp-n-to-join-central-govt-after-leaders-release.html', 'summary': 'After induction of two Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum-Nepal ministers into the federal government on Friday, leaders of the Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal have said they are ready to join the Cabinet too.full story »'}, {'image_link': 'https://assets-cdn.ekantipur.com/images/the-kathmandu-post-printedition/loan-copy_1527988545-600x0.jpg', 'title': 'Youth start-up loan plan elicits academia cynicism ', 'date': 'Kathmandu', 'source': 'ekantipur', 'news_link': 'https://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-06-03/youth-start-up-loan-plan-elicits-academia-cynicism.html', 'summary': 'The government’s budgetary allocation to disburse loans for start-ups taking academic certificates of Nepali youth as collateral has drawn cynicism from a section of experts in Kathmandu.full story »'}]
